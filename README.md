Data Thieves!

A Digital Nomad Adventure!
Digital nomads are people who travel freely while working remotely using technology and the internet. 
Such people generally have minimal material possessions and work remotely in temporary housing, hotels, cafes, public libraries, co-working spaces, or recreational vehicles, using Wi-Fi, smartphones or mobile hotspots to access the Internet.

Data Sources:
